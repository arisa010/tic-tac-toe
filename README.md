# Tic Tac Toe
The briefest description of my cool project and why you should all use it.

## :computer: [Click here](https://arisa010.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) to see my live project!

## :page_facing_up: About
- The game starts right after the link is opened

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
game logic
- when it's "x" turn, any box clicked "x" appears 
- when it's "o" turn, any box clicked "o" appears 
- two players "x" & "o" switch in intervals after every click
on a (3 x 3)  grid 
- three outcomes
    - 3"x" appear in a row or in a diagonal - x wins
    - 3 "o" appear in a row or in a diagonal - o wins
    - grid is filled - a draw





- Add screenshots/drawings of doodles/plans during the planning phase.
- Flow charts of app logic.

## :rocket: Cool tech
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript 


## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- After the grid id filled i need to double click to be able to aleart the "its a draw" message.
- Anything a LOT broken
- Buttons to not click too many times (cause its broken :unamused:)

## :sob: Lessons learnt
if I could wind back the clock i would focus on logic and the bigger picture of the game and later spend time on getting small things working.

## :white_check_mark: Future features
i would add animations and add more functions
